# Start-Overlay-in-Application-View-for-Gnome-40-
A updated version of the extension Start Overlay in Application View created by tmk (https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/tmk). Tested on Gnome 42, didn't had time to test on 40 and 41 versions but it should work (lemme know if it don't please :)). This extension makes Super key press open Applications Grid instead of Overview.
