# Start Overlay in Application View for Gnome 40+:
A updated version of the extension Start Overlay in Application View created by tmk (https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/tmk). Tested on Gnome 42, didn't had time to test on 40 and 41 versions but it should work (lemme know if it don't please :)). This extension makes Super key press open Applications Grid instead of Overview.

## Manual instalation:
For manual installation, just paste the folder containing the extension.js and metadata.js files at ".local/share/gnome-shell/extensions" folder, then restart your gnome-shell (alt+f2, type r on command box) or simply restart your computer. After that the extension should appear on extensions manager.
